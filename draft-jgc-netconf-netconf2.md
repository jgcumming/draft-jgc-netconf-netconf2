--- abstract

The Network Configuration Protocol version 2.0 (NETCONF2) defined 
  in this document provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and 
  delete the configuration of network devices as well as mechanisms
  to stream YANG modelled data.  It provides for flexible data 
  encoding options for all data and protocol messages.  
  The NETCONF protocol operations are realized as messages, 
  remote procedure calls (RPCs) and notifications.  
  This document obsoletes RFC 6241.
